## Introduction

This Vehicle dataset is available in kaggle [Vehicle Dataset from Cardekho- Cardetails Version3](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=Car+details+v3.csv).

The dataset contains the details of used cars.It includes various attributes like the car's make, manufacturing year, fuel efficiency, fuel type, transmission type, and more.

**Objective:**
The goal is to analyze the dataset to identify key factors influencing the price of a used car and build a predictive model for estimating its cost. 

The dataset contains the following attributes 

|    | Attributes       | Description                                                                        |

### Import dataset
```{r message=FALSE}
library(readr)
car_details = read_csv("Car details v3.csv")
```

### Total number of instances
```{r}
nrow(car_details)
```

### Excluding missing values from dataset
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
col_name=""
for(col_name in names(car_details))
{
  if(sum(is.na(car_details[col_name]))>0)
  {
    print(c(col_name,":",sum(is.na(car_details[col_name]))))
